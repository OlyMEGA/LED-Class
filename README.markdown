Sketches for LED Light Classes at OlyMEGA

---

Examples/LightDecay:

1. Open LightDecay.ino in Arduino (utils.h should also open)

2. Hook up your LPD8806 based strip

3. tell it how many LEDs you have (set numLEDs in utils.h)

4. Watch the fireworks :)

5. Open utils.h and play with values for decayAmount, decayFactor, and addInterval, to affect how often new colors appear, and how quickly they fade out (decay)
